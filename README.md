Incomplete iOS 12-14 Tweak for controlling iOS without touchscreen.

# Description
This uses VoiceOver to move accross the screen using volume buttons, controller support was also added, this was experimental since i didn't finished it.
Probably you can also control the device by sending the notifications from a binary (so you could control it from SSH).
